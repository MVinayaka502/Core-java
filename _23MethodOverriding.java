// using method overRiding in java
//Overriding in Java occurs when a subclass (child class) implements a method that is already
// defined in the superclass or Base Class.The overriding method must have the same name,
// parameters, and return type as the method in the parent class.
// This allows subclasses to modify inherited behavior while maintaining a consistent interface.
//The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type,
// and parameters as the method in the superclass.The method called is determined at runtime,
// allowing dynamic behavior based on the objectâ€™s type.Only non-static methods can be overridden.
//The@Override annotation ensures the method is correctly overridden and helps avoid errors.
